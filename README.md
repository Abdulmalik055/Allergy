# The Main Idea from Project:
### The main idea of the project:
The idea of the project is a search for the barcode number, and the result of the search shows us whether this product causes allergies or not For example, a person with gluten sensitivity and wanted to search for whether this bread is gluten-free, so he writes the barcode of the product and displays a result of whether it is free or not.
